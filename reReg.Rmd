When the study interest is placed on evaluating the covariate effect on the recurrent event process
and/or the terminal event, the `reReg()` function from the \pkg{reReg} package provides
approaches to fit semiparametric regression model to recurrent event data.
The `reReg()` function offers users options to choose from some of the most common models.
In general, a joint scale-change model for the rate function of the recurrent event process and
the hazard function of the failure time is formulated as follow: 
\begin{equation}
\lambda(t) = Z \lambda_0(te^{X^\top\alpha})e^{X^\top\beta};
h(t) = Z h_0(te^{X^\top\eta})e^{X^\top\theta},
\label{general}
\end{equation}		      
where $Z$ is a latent shared frailty variable to account for association between the two types of
outcomes, $\lambda_0(\cdot)$ is the baseline rate function,
$h_0(\cdot)$ is the baseline hazard function, and the regression coefficients
$(\alpha, \eta)$ and $(\beta, \theta)$ correspond to the shape and size parameters  
of the rate function and hazard function, respectively.
In contrast to usual shared-frailty models that require a parametric assumption on the distribution
of the frailty random variable,
<!--so that the likelihood method can be used to estimate the joint model,-->
the `reReg()` function provides semiparametric estimation procedures that do not require the
knowledge about the frailty as motivated by \citet{wang2001analyzing}.
As a result, the dependence between recurrent events and failure event is left unspecified
and the proposed implementations accommodate informative censoring.

Model \ref{general} includes several popular semiparametric models as special cases,
which can be specified via the `method` argument with the 
type of rate function and hazard separated by `|`.
For examples, the joint Cox model proposed by \citet{huang2004joint} is a special case of \ref{general}
when $\alpha = \eta = 0$ and can be called by `method = "cox|cox"`;
the joint Accelerated Mean model proposed by \citet{xu2017joint} is a special case when
$\alpha = \eta$ and can be called by `method = "am|am"`.
<!--Another option is `ar` for the accerlated rate model ($\beta = \theta = 0$).-->
When the primary interest is in the covariate effects on the risk of recurrent
events and treating the terminal event as nuisances, i.e., $\eta = \theta = 0$,
model \ref{general} reduces to the generalized scale-change model proposed
in \citet{xu2019generalized}, called by `method = "sc|."`.
Users can mixed and match the `method` arguments depending on the application.
For example, `method = "cox|ar"` fits a Cox proportional model for the recurrent event rate function
and an accelerated rate model for the terminal event hazard function,
i.e., this assumes $\alpha = \theta = 0$ in \ref{general}. 
For inference, the asymptotic variance is estimated from an efficient resampling-based sandwich
estimator motivated by \citet{zeng2008efficient}.
The resampling approach is faster than the conventional bootstrap method as it only requires
evaluating perturbed estimating equations a large number of times rather than solving them.
The following codes fit the joint Cox model with 200 (default) resampling replicates:
<!--and the generalized scale-change model, respectively. -->
```{R, cache = TRUE}
system.time(fit <- reReg(fn, df0, method = "cox|cox"))
```
The `summary()` method prints the results of the model fits:
```{R}
summary(fit)
 ```
After a model is fitted, the baseline rate function and hazard function can be visualized
by plotting the `reReg()` object.
Methods proposed by authors \citet{lin2000semiparametric}, \citet{ghosh2002marginal}, and
\citet{ghosh2003semiparametric} are also implemented in \pkg{reReg}.
