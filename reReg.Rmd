When the study interest is to evaluate the covariate effect on the recurrent event process
and/or the terminal event, the `reReg()` function from the \pkg{reReg} package
fits semiparametric regression models to recurrent event data.
A general joint model for the rate of the recurrent event process and
the hazard of the failure time can be formulated as follow: 
\begin{equation}
\lambda(t) = Z \lambda_0(te^{X^\top\alpha})e^{X^\top\beta};
h(t) = Z h_0(te^{X^\top\eta})e^{X^\top\theta},
\label{general}
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is a latent shared frailty variable to account for association between the two types of
outcomes, $\lambda_0(\cdot)$ is the baseline rate function,
$h_0(\cdot)$ is the baseline hazard function, and the regression coefficients
$(\alpha, \eta)$ and $(\beta, \theta)$ correspond to the shape and size parameters 
of the rate function and hazard function, respectively.
In contrast to many shared-frailty models that require a parametric assumption,
<!--so that the likelihood method can be used to estimate the joint model,-->
following the idea of \citet{wang2001analyzing},
the `reReg()` function implements semiparametric estimation procedures that do not require the
knowledge about the frailty distribution.
As a result, the dependence between recurrent events and failure event is left unspecified
and the proposed implementations accommodate informative censoring.

Model \eqref{general} includes several popular semiparametric models as special cases,
which can be specified via the `method` argument with the 
rate function and hazard function separated by "`|`".
For examples, the joint Cox model proposed by \citet{huang2004joint} is a special case of
\eqref{general} when $\alpha = \eta = 0$ and can be called by `method = "cox|cox"`;
the joint Accelerated Mean model proposed by \citet{xu2017joint} is a special case when
$\alpha = \beta$ and $\eta = \theta$ and can be called by `method = "am|am"`.
<!--Another option is `ar` for the accerlated rate model ($\beta = \theta = 0$).-->
When the primary interest is in the covariate effects on the risk of recurrent
events and treating the terminal event as nuisances, i.e., $\eta = \theta = 0$,
model \eqref{general} reduces to the generalized scale-change model proposed
in \citet{xu2019generalized}, called by `method = "sc|."`.
Users can mixed and match the `method` arguments depending on the application.
For example, `method = "cox|ar"` postulate a Cox proportional model for the recurrent event rate
function and an accelerated rate model for the terminal event hazard function,
i.e., this assumes $\alpha = \theta = 0$ in \eqref{general}. 
For inference, the asymptotic variance is estimated from an efficient resampling-based sandwich
estimator motivated by \citet{zeng2008efficient}.
The resampling approach is faster than the conventional bootstrap method as it only requires
evaluating perturbed estimating equations rather than solving them.
The following code fit the joint Cox model with 200 (default) resampling replicates:
<!--and the generalized scale-change model, respectively. -->
```{R, cache = TRUE}
system.time(fit <- reReg(fn, df0, method = "cox|cox"))
```
The `summary()` method prints the results of the model fits:
```{R}
summary(fit)
 ```
After a model is fitted, the baseline rate function and hazard function can be visualized
by plotting the `reReg()` object.
Methods proposed by authors \citet{lin2000semiparametric}, \citet{ghosh2002marginal}, and
\citet{ghosh2003semiparametric} are also implemented in \pkg{reReg}.
