When the study interest is placed on evaluating the covariate effect on
the recurrent event process and/or the terminal event, the
\texttt{reReg()} function from the \pkg{reReg} package provides
approaches to fit semiparametric regression model to recurrent event
data. The \texttt{reReg()} function offers users options to choose from
some of the most common models. In general, a joint scale-change model
for the rate function of the recurrent event process and the hazard
function of the failure time is formulated as follow:

\begin{equation}
\lambda(t) = Z \lambda_0(te^{X^\top\alpha})e^{X^\top\beta};
h(t) = Z h_0(te^{X^\top\eta})e^{X^\top\theta},
\label{general}
\end{equation}

where \(Z\) is a latent shared frailty variable to account for
association between the two types of outcomes, \(\lambda_0(\cdot)\) is
the baseline rate function, \(h_0(\cdot)\) is the baseline hazard
function, and the regression coefficients \((\alpha, \eta)\) and
\((\beta, \theta)\) correspond to the shape and size parameters\\
of the rate function and hazard function, respectively. In contrast to
usual shared-frailty models that require a parametric assumption on the
distribution of the frailty random variable, the \texttt{reReg()}
function provides semiparametric estimation procedures that do not
require the knowledge about the frailty as motivated by
\citet{wang2001analyzing}. As a result, the dependence between recurrent
events and failure event is left unspecified and the proposed
implementations accommodate informative censoring.

Model \ref{general} includes several popular semiparametric models as
special cases, which can be specified via the \texttt{method} argument
with the type of rate function and hazard separated by
\texttt{\textbar{}}. For examples, the joint Cox model proposed by
\citet{huang2004joint} is a special case of \ref{general} when
\(\alpha = \eta = 0\) and can be called by
\texttt{method\ =\ "cox\textbar{}cox"}; the joint Accelerated Mean model
proposed by \citet{xu2017joint} is a special case when \(\alpha = \eta\)
and can be called by \texttt{method\ =\ "am\textbar{}am"}. When the
primary interest is in the covariate effects on the risk of recurrent
events and treating the terminal event as nuisances, i.e.,
\(\eta = \theta = 0\), model \ref{general} reduces to the generalized
scale-change model proposed in \citet{xu2019generalized}, called by
\texttt{method\ =\ "sc\textbar{}."}. Users can mixed and match the
\texttt{method} arguments depending on the application. For example,
\texttt{method\ =\ "cox\textbar{}ar"} fits a Cox proportional model for
the recurrent event rate function and an accelerated rate model for the
terminal event hazard function, i.e., this assumes
\(\alpha = \theta = 0\) in \ref{general}. For inference, the asymptotic
variance is estimated from an efficient resampling-based sandwich
estimator motivated by \citet{zeng2008efficient}. The resampling
approach is faster than the conventional bootstrap method as it only
requires evaluating perturbed estimating equations a large number of
times rather than solving them. The following codes fit the joint Cox
model with 200 (default) resampling replicates:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{system.time}\NormalTok{(fit <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{reReg}\NormalTok{(fn, df0, }\DataTypeTok{method =} \StringTok{"cox|cox"}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
   user  system elapsed 
  1.884   0.016   1.903 
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{summary()} method prints the results of the model fits:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(fit)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Call: 
reReg(formula = fn, data = df0, method = "cox|cox")

Recurrent event process:
             Estimate StdErr z.value p.value
chemoTreated   -0.189  0.244  -0.778   0.437

Terminal event:
             Estimate StdErr z.value p.value  
chemoTreated    0.519  0.286   1.815    0.07 .
\end{verbatim}

After a model is fitted, the baseline rate function and hazard function
can be visualized by plotting the \texttt{reReg()} object. Methods
proposed by authors \citet{lin2000semiparametric},
\citet{ghosh2002marginal}, and \citet{ghosh2003semiparametric} are also
implemented in \pkg{reReg}. See \url{wenjie-stat.me/reda/} and
