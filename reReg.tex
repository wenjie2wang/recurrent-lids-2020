The \texttt{reReg()} function from the \pkg{reReg} package provides
flexible approaches to fit semiparametric regression model to recurrent
event data. At the default specification, a joint scale-change model for
the recurrent event process and the failure time is fitted.
Specifically, the joint model takes the form of

\begin{equation}
\lambda(t) = Z \lambda_0(te^{X^\top\alpha})e^{X^\top\beta};
h(t) = Z h_0(te^{X^\top\alpha})e^{X^\top\beta},
\end{equation}

where \(Z\) is a latent shared frailty variable to account for
association between the two types of outcomes, and \((\alpha, \beta)\)
is the regression coefficient.
